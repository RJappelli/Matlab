\subsection{}
We use the bisection method to compute the zeroes of the following functions:
(a) $$f(x) = x^3 + 4 - 1/x$$ has a root $x = 0.249038$\\

(b) $$f(x) = -exp(-x) + exp(-x^2) $$ has a root $x = 0$ and a root at $51$, obtained varying the starting points.

\subsection{}
$$b * q + d * q^\phi - (a - c) = 0 $$
Assume $$ a = 3, b = 0.5, c = d = 1, \psi = 0.5$$
We then have $$ \dfrac{q}{2} + \sqrt{q} -2 = 0 $$
  analytical solution:   \\
$$ \dfrac{q}{2} + \sqrt{q} -2 = 0 $$
  bisection method: 1.52786 \\
  with matlab built-in function \textit{fzero}: 1.527864045000420 \\
  
  
  \section{Exercise 4}
  
  We load the data with import data as a table, excluding raws with unimportable cells. After cheching with isnan, we have 104 countries in our dataset.\\
